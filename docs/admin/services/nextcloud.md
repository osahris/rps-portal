## Group folder sync

For every group in the Keycloak Groups hierachy a group folder in the Nextcloud will be created with the RPS Nextcloud Sync script.

When a group has been removed, only managers of the parent group will be able to access this groups folders. Hint: Currently this also applies to Group folders manually generated by a Nextcloud admin user.
