Welcome to the Documentation for Research Project Suite
=======================================================

Here we try to document different aspects of this software stack.
It is structured for three different target audiences:

 * [end-user help](enduser)
 * [administrator documentation](admin)
 * [developer documentation](developer)

As this documentation is a [wiki](enduser/wiki), feel free to add any information you feel is missing. All texts here are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, either version 3 of that license, or, at your option, any later version. By adding something to this wiki, you agree to license your further contributions also under that license.
