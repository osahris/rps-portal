Welcome to the Documentation for Research Project Suite
=======================================================

Here we try to document different aspects of this software stack.
It is structured for three different target audiences:

 * [end-user help](enduser)
 * [administrator documentation](admin)
 * [developer documentation](developer)

As this documentation is a [wiki](enduser/wiki), feel free to add any information you feel is missing. All texts here are licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, either version 3 of that license, or, at your option, any later version. By adding something to this wiki, you agree to license your further contributions also under that license.

RPS is designed to provide pleasant experience on multiple layers of interaction. Keeping this in mind, we split our manual in the following levels:

[**Endusers**](./enduser) -- before you finally decide to get RPS at your service, it is convenient to put yourself on the regular user's place. This manual will provide a trip to the user experience hiding all the backstage stuff info away.

[**Admins**](./admin) -- now that you know RPS is a great offer, you may get acquainted with the default implemented possibilities for the staff that with be granted extended rights in your RPS instance.

[**Developers**](./developer) -- we don't only provide RPS in open-source but also aim to keep its usage clean and clear. Learn how to implement features and improvements to your RPS instance based on your own needs.
