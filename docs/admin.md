Notes about systems administration
==================================

This part of the documentation is targeted specifically at the system
administrators that keep everything running - also sometimes called the
"Ops team".

This document is mostly a skeleton for now - please feel free to at
site-specific notes to whereever the doc is hosted at your site
(ususally a site-specific or project-specific git branch).

Administrators that perform further system integration work might
additionally need to refer to the [developer documentation](../developer).

Administrative tasks to be performed regularly:

 * Security updates provided by the software distributor need to be applied (

   [servers](../admin/servers-linux/security-updates) )
 * Backups need to be run manually or verified that they are running (
