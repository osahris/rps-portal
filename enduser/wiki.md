The wiki is used to centrally collect information, for example on the usage and administration of the IT system.

The wiki is reachable at address <https://...> .

### Registering a user account

You can change any page in the wiki yourself. If you do not yet have a wiki account, please create one yourself by clicking the "Edit" link on the top left of any wiki page. After another click on the "Register" button, enter a new user name and password. Including an email address in your registration is optional. However, without an email address on file, the wiki system cannot automatically inform you about events of interest to you, such as changes to certain pages.

### Editing pages

To edit an existing page, click the "edit" link above the main page text. You will reach the Editor page, which displays the markup text of the page-to-be-edited in a large editing area. Usually this will be in [Markdown format](../ikiwiki/markdown). The page [Formatting wiki pages](../ikiwiki/formatting) contains some tips on using this format.

Once you are finished editing, use the "Preview" button to render a preview of the modified text. Any mistakes in markdown formatting will quickly become obvious this way. If everything looks fine to you, please enter a short description on what you changed into the single line below the main text field (e.g "completed list of pterosaurs"). Finally, klick on "Save Page". Our sincere thanks, you have successfully contributed to the wiki.


### Creating new pages

Once in a while, you will come accross a reference text, which is not itself a link. Instead a small question mark appears next to the link. This will look like in the following example:

* [Catalogue of known plesiosaurs](plesiosaurs)

To create a wiki page from such a placeholder, just click on the little question mark. Next, using the "Page location" chooser, select where the new page should be within the wiki's hierarchy. The actual editing of the pages happens as described above. The page should be created in English, and possibly be [translated](translate) afterwards.
